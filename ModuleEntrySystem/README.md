# Module-Entry System
The system works similarly to reaction roles, but more advanced:

- Using a create command, I can create an embed with a reaction role to enter/leave a given module (add/remove role).
- An application is sent into the chat and only officers from that requested module (or admins) can approve the application.
- User can anytime leave modules using the reactions on the embeds.
