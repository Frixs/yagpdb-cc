# Anti-Spy System
The system is for larger communities that want to prevent passive members to spy on the community chats.

- The community must define a special role that marks people as "inactive".
- Users get removed from the role if a user reacts, sends a message, or is active in a voice channel.
- If they are not active in any way mentioned above, the role is assigned to them again after a set period of time.
